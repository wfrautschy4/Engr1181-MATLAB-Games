<h1>OSU Engr 1181 - Simple Game Final Project</h1>

<p>The goal for this project was to use the SimpleGameEngine.m library to create a "simple" game. My implementation was the game Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4. Both with an AI using the minimax algorithm to find the best play to make.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>You must have matlab installed on your computer and a matlab account to run. Once you have matlab opened, simply run the tictactoe.m or connect4.m scripts to launch the game</p>
